# site-test

I wanted to set up a site on GitHub Pages and have it visible on a personal domain. I followed [this sites](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/using-github-pages-to-host-your-website) flow and viola, I have a GitHub Pages site showing up on my personal domain [brgrhnt.com](http://brgrhnt.com)!
